# IPsec VPN FAQ

## What is IBM Cloud VPN?
{: faq}

IBM Cloud VPN access is designed to allow users to remotely manage all servers securely over the IBM Cloud private network.  A VPN connection from your location to the private network allows for unlimited file transfers, out-of-band management, and server rescue through an encrypted VPN tunnel. With VPN access, you can:

* Establish a VPN connection to the private network using SSL, PPTP or IPSEC
* Access your server via its private 10.x.x.x IP address using SSH or RDP
* Connect to your serverâ€™s IPMI IP address for additional server management or rescue needs.


## Does the SSL VPN also perform PPTP, IPSEC or other VPN protocols?
{: faq}

Currently the SSL VPN gateway uses a browser-based SSL VPN plugin or a proprietary client for creating connections. We will continue to bring more VPN connectivity options to the private network. The SSL VPN was selected for ease of use and compatibility.
